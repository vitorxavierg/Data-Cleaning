Data Cleaning techniques using Python

Data Cleaning is a crucial step when dealing with data. It enables the data to be ready for taking reliable insight from it.
I've made some projects in this subject:

This is the second part of a three-part project I've made. A lot of different cleaning techniques were used.
The goal here is to clean the data for data analysis. Check out the medium article to see the other two parts.
